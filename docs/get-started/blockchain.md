# Getting Started Building a Blockchain

If you have no experience with either Rust or blockchain technology, it is recommended that you read and understand the pre-requisites first.

_Other suggested order of tutorials / help guides go here.._

## Pre-Requisites

* What is a blockchain?
* Rust

## Entry-Level Tutorials
* [Creating a Custom Substrate Chain](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs/creating-a-custom-substrate-chain) - _This is a relatively short ( < 1 hour ) overview on generating your own blockchain with Substrate._
* [Substrate Collectables Workshop (Substrate Kitties)](https://shawntabrizi.github.io/substrate-collectables-workshop/#/) _This is an approximately five-hour-long tutorial which will walk you all the way from creating the blockchain, generating the smart contract code, and integrating with a user interface._

## Advanced Tutorials
* _Some of the items above may belong here_
* Interacting with other parachains
* Combining RMs
* [Local Node Detection](TODO)
* [Production Deployment](TODO) _Is it possible to deploy a substrate chain "to production"?_
* [IPFS](TODO) _Using a web3 storage provider_

## Useful Development Tools
* [Substrate](https://www.parity.io/substrate/) _Easily generate Polkadot Runtime Environment-compatible blockchains._
* [Polkadot-JS](https://polkadot.js.org/) _A collection of tools, interfaces and libraries around the Polkadot project. Polkadot does JavaScript._
* [Polkascan](https://polkascan.io/)
* [Polkawallet](https://polkawallet.io/) _Cross-chain asset management._
* [Speckle-OS](https://www.speckleos.io/) _Manage assets and interact with dapps on the Polkadot network)
