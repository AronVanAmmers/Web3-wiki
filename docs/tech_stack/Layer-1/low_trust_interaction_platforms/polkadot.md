# Polkadot

## Overview
Polkadot is a platform that allows diverse blockchains to transfer messages, including value, in a trust-free fashion; sharing their unique features while pooling their security. In brief, Polkadot is a scalable heterogeneous multi-chain technology.

Polkadot is heterogeneous because it is entirely flexible and makes no assumption about the nature or structure of the chains in the network. Even non-blockchain systems or data structures can become parachains if they fulfill a set of criteria.

Polkadot may be considered equivalent to a set of independent chains (e.g. a set containing Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Namecoin and Bitcoin) except with important additions: pooled security and trust-free interchain transactability.

Many of the native [parachains](../low_trust_interaction_protocols/parachains.md) of Polkadot will be written using a [Polkadot Runtime Environment](../low_trust_interaction_protocols/polkadot_runtime_environment.md) SDK (e.g. Parity Technologies' [Substrate](../low_trust_interaction_protocols/substrate.md)).
