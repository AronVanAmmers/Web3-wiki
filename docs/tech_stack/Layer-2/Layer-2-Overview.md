# Layer 2
## Overview

Layer 2 is an enhancement layer for the lower layers of the Web 3 tech stack. Included in this component are meta-protocols, or layer 2 protocols, that provide enhanced features such as scaling, compute and encrypted messaging.

This layer is made up of a single component layer.

## Components

**(7) Second layer protocols**

  * (7.1) [State channels](State_channels.md)
  * (7.2) [Plasma protocols](Plasma_protocols.md)
  * (7.3) [Encrypted storage](Encrypted_storage.md)

    - _NuCypher, Parity Secret Store_


  * (7.4) [Storage incentivization](Storage_incentivization.md)
  * (7.5) [Heavy computation](Heavy_computation.md)
  * (7.6) [Distributed secret management](Distributed_secret_management.md)


## Resources

  * [Scaling Summary Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BQ0bK_LhSQvxtvXryVoIcmxeKMuVJCq6oD0aS5_hpC8/edit) - comparison of many scaling solutions across 13 key factors.
