# Basics and Pre-Requisites

Once you've decided to start building on Polkadot you'll need to know a few basics in order to get the most out of the rest of this development wiki.

It might be obvious (and not needed to be stated), but it's good to have a good understanding about the technology called blockchain and how its generally used. Start with the [Overview](../Information) section on this wiki to learn the basic concepts of Polkadot.

If you've developed on Ethereum before you might want to check out the comparison to [smart contract engineering](./smart_contracts.md). Want to just get started right away? Head over to the [Starter Guide](./starter.md).
